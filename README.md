# TODO

convert networking code to just apply args to function?


Networking code:

can you HTML5 rotate and have the mouse move events still work?

- reverse visualization for other player
  - just HTML5 rotate the grid? => don't think so, since this would prevent ownership by spacial orientation
    - or first player gets "rightside-up" (orientation #1), second player gets "upside-down" (orientation #2)
    - each player generates a random #, lowest # determines who is player #1.
    - nodejs server i++'s on each connect, lowest connect # determines who is player #1 / #2. => makes this not run on SAAS messaging platforms?
  - handle transformation within the event passing structure
    - YOUR private zone is on the bottom of the screen
    
- then:
  - bottom hidden zone is mine
  - top hidden zone is theirs

- add fixed / hidden zone for other player
- make hidden zone player-specific
  - create some sort of concept of player

- each card gets an owner, based on who dragged it to the gameboard (only need to keep cards separate for additional games?)


send event change stream?

- cardOnAdd
- cardOnMove
- cardOnEnd
- etc?

send model change stream?

- **$scope.cards.push**
- extractCard
- moveStackToFront
- stackMove
- snapToGrid (??)
- cardRotate
- cardSpread
- cardFlip
- appendStack
- changeStack (some of them)

networking-related:

- use images from online source?
  - put image source url at top of deck file?
- scale the game board styles (not use fixed pixels)
- some means of coordinating display size between two people?
- rate limit move events

Other Required Features:

- counters:
  - click to increase
  - alt-click to decrease?
  - different colors?

- way to shuffle stack

Optional:

- slide-out side section where anything can be dropped
- better highlighting for compact stacksâ€“use an alpha mask?
- work on ipad...?

Refactors?

- some sort of zone hierarchy display options so we don't have to explicitly check for zone position, i.e. (compact || c.zone == 'fixed'))?
- use actual object of some sort for card?


## Code Documentation

- cards are arranged in stacks. 
- in a stack, the "base" card is the one on the bottom (which has the lowest z-index).
- it is the base card that snaps to a grid.
- each card placed onto another card is offset down and to the right (and to a higher z-index), by default.
- if a stack is more than 10 cards, than it is arranged as a conpact stack, which is just each card is placed slightly (~ 0.5px) to the right.
- a spread stack is arranged the same way as a default stack, except in reverse, so:
  - it is aligned according to the top card, not the base card.
  - the stack is offset up and to the left, instead of down and to the right.
- when the spread stack is unspread, the base card should still be aligned with the grid.


### ZONES

the primary board zone:
- stacks < 10 display in default tiered
- stacks >= 10 display in compact

fixed:
- all stacks display compact

private:
- same as primary
- cards are visible only to you.

fn-click, expands pile, visibilty depends on location
  

## Plan

- drag and drop individual cards, snap to grid
- stack cards on top of one another, linked list should work.
- change stack display mode to default, compact, reverse default.
